#Aggregation: In aggregation, the related objects are 
#considered as parts of the main object, but they can exist 
#independently. The main object does not have a strong 
#ownership of its parts, 
#and the parts can be shared among multiple main objects.
# In code, aggregation is represented by having a reference to another class within the main class, but the related objects 
#are not necessarily created or managed by the main object.

# Aggregation is a concept in which an object of one class can own or access another independent object of another class. 

#     It represents Has-Aâ€™s relationship.
#     It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
#     In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.
